Today we have installed Git and worked on github.

Commands used today:

1) git clone "Repo url"   // To clone a repository to your device

2)  git add "Filename.extension" //To add the file at the location

3) git commit -m "comment"  . (add full stop also)  //To commit the file\

4) git push //To push the file to github
